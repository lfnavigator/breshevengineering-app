# ⚙️ AirBearing.AI — Breshev Engineering

**AirBearing.AI** is a web-based engineering tool for rapid calculation of **gas-lubricated bearing parameters** and **rotor dynamics**.  
It combines classical analytical models with modern Python-based automation.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

- Calculates axial load capacity of conical air bearings
- Uses real physical and geometric parameters
- Visualizes results with interactive plots
- Fast and intuitive interface for engineers, students, and researchers

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- Analytical model based on decades of rotor-bearing research
- Expandable architecture (FEM, hybrid models planned)
- Scientific-grade calculation outputs
- Built for use in real-world engineering applications

---

## 🛠 How to Use

1. Enter bearing geometry and air supply parameters
2. Click **“Calculate”**
3. Get computed results and load capacity plots

No installation or login required on Hugging Face demo.
